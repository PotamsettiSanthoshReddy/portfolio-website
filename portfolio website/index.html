                "Pac-Man" is a classic arcade game where players control a yellow character navigating a maze,<br>
                eating pellets and avoiding ghosts. The objective is to clear the maze while earning points.<br>

            <h3>Project 2</h3>
            <p>i had created 2nd project as login page. it was very cool.i had added some animations to it.<br>
                A login page is a gateway to secure online platforms. Users input credentials—typically username<br>
                and password—to access personalized accounts or services. It ensures privacy, data protection,<br>
                and user authentication. Modern login pages often incorporate security features like two-factor<br>
                authentication to enhance protection against unauthorized access. </p>

            <h3>Project 3</h3>
            <p>i had created 3rd project as snake game. it was very cool.It all was done by using only by python.<br>
                The Snake game is a classic arcade game where players control a snake that grows in length as<br>
                it consumes food pellets. The objective is to navigate the snake around the screen, avoiding<br>
                collisions with walls and the snake's own body. As the snake grows longer, the game becomes increasingly
                challenging. </p>
